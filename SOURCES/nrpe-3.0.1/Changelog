3.0 - 2016-08-01
-----------------
SECURITY
- Fix for CVE-2014-2913
- Added function to clean the environment before forking. (John Frickson)

ENHANCEMENTS
- Added support for optional config file to check_nrpe. With the new SSL
  parameters, the line was getting long. The config file is specified with
  --config-file=<path> or -f <path> parameters. The config file must look
  like command line options, but the options can be on separate lines. It
  MUST NOT include --config-file (-f), --command (-c) or --args (-a). If any
  options are in both the config file and on the command line, the command line
  options are used.
- make can now add users and groups using "make install-groups-users" (John Frickson)
- Added "nrpe-uninstall" script to the same directory nrpe get installed to (John Frickson)
- Updated code so configure && make will work on AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, OS X.
  There should be no errors or warnings. Let me know if any errors or
  warning appear (John Frickson)
- Added command-line option to prevent forking, since some of the init
  replacements (such as systemd, etc.) don't want daemons to fork (John Frickson)
- Added autoconf macros and additional files to better support multi-platform
  config and compile. The default will still set up to install to
  /usr/local/nagios but I added a new configure option:
  '--enable-install-method=<method>'. If <method> is 'opt', everything will
  install to '/opt/nagios'. If <method> is 'os', installation will be to O/S-
  and distribution-specific locations, such as /usr/sbin, /usr/lib/nagios,
  /etc/nagios, and so on.
- Added additional init and inetd config files to support more systems,
  including SuSE, Debian, Slackware, Gentoo, *BSD, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, OS X.
- Added listen_queue_size as configuration option (Vadim Antipov, Kaspersky Lab)
- Reworked SSL/TLS. See the README.SSL.md file for full info. (John Frickson)
- Added support for version 3 variable sized packets up to 64KB. nrpe will
  accept either version from check_nrpe. check_nrpe will try to send a
  version 3 packet first, and fall back to version 2. check_nrpe can be forced
  to only send version 2 packets if the switch `-2` is used. (John Frickson)
- Added extended timeout syntax in the -t <secs>:<status> format. (ABrist)

FIXES
- Fixed configure to check more places for SSL headers/libs. (John Frickson)
- Added ifdefs for complete_SSL_shutdown to compile without SSL. (Matthew L. Daniel)

- check_nrpe does not parse passed arguments correctly (John Frickson)
- NRPE should not start if cannot write pid file (John Frickson)
- Fixed out-of-bounds error (return code 255) for some failures (John Frickson)
- Connection Timeout and Connection Refused messages need a new line (Andrew Widdersheim)
- allowed_hosts doesn't work, if one of the hostnames can't be resolved by dns (John Frickson)
- allowed_hosts doesn't work with a hostname resolving to an IPv6 address (John Frickson)
- Return UNKNOWN when issues occur (Andrew Widdersheim)
- NRPE returns OK if check can't be executed (Andrew Widdersheim)
